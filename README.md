Machine Learning Projects


 Welcome to my machine learning projects portfolio featuring two distinct endeavors: a cutting-edge chatbot and an AI music composer. The chatbot project showcases the synergy of natural language processing and deep learning, resulting in an intelligent conversational agent adept at understanding and responding to user queries with human-like fluency. On the other hand, the AI music composer project delves into the realm of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), paving the way for the creation of original musical compositions imbued with creativity and coherence. Explore the intersection of AI and human interaction with the chatbot, and witness the fusion of algorithmic prowess and artistic expression with the AI music composer. These projects stand as testament to my dedication to pushing the boundaries of machine learning innovation across diverse domains.
